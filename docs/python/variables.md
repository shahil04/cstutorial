# Variables in Python

Variables store values and are created when first assigned. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't declare variable types explicitly.

## Example

```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 30
print(name, 'is', age, 'years old')
```

## Output

```
Alice is 30 years old
```

## Practice Questions

1. How do you assign a string to a variable?
2. What happens if you assign different types to the same variable?

<div class="inline-ad" data-ad="inline"></div>
